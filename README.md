Overview

In an era of increasing diversity and complexity in administrative demands, the public sector must secure personnel, maximize their potential, and effectively carry out public duties. This study conducts an empirical analysis of human resource utilization (job change intention, job engagement, and workplace satisfaction) among national public servants, using individual-level data from the "Survey on Awareness of Public and Private Sector Workers" conducted by the National Personnel Authority in FY2022.

The dataset comprises survey responses from 1,000 workers across both the public and private sectors. The survey includes demographic information such as gender and workplace location, as well as workplace environment assessments (e.g., career support and ease of consultation).

The analysis consists of two major components:

Multiple regression analysis for factor exploration

Difference-in-differences (DID) analysis for causal inference

Multiple Regression Analysis

The multiple regression analysis examines potential factors affecting the dependent variables. Independent variables include factors such as level of authority, workplace openness, and organization of work and personnel.

Findings suggest that workplace openness and work and personnel organization have the strongest correlation with all dependent variables and show significant differences between the public and private sectors. However, job change intention was only significantly correlated for female respondents.

Difference-in-Differences (DID) Analysis

The DID analysis investigates the impact of excessive workload in central government ministries on the dependent variables, using a dummy variable representing excessive workload in central ministries (specific age group Ã— Tokyo-based work) as an independent variable. Contrary to intuition, no significant correlation was observed for most dependent variables.

Policy Implications

Based on the findings, the following policy recommendations are proposed:

Improving workplace openness: Introduce decentralized personnel evaluation and 360-degree evaluation

Organizing work and necessary personnel: Publicly disclose overtime hours and reasons for overwork for each ministry and department
